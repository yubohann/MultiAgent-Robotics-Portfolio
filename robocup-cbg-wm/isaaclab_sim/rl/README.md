# RoboCup VisionRL RL Interface

The active development path is CBG-WM, with uncertainty-aware belief tokens,
typed object interactions, a probabilistic dynamics ensemble, and Flow-proposal
CVaR MPC. See [`docs/cbg_wm.md`](../../docs/cbg_wm.md) for its training,
scoring, OOD and ablation contract. The published SAC Flow run documented
below remains the legacy baseline, and its historical metrics stay labeled as
SAC Flow results.

This folder contains the reinforcement-learning bridge for the IsaacLab
two-robot visual-target arena. The current research path is
`CBG-WM belief graph + ensemble dynamics + Flow proposal risk MPC`.

## Current Research Policy

- Algorithm `cbg_wm_sac_flow_selfplay`.
- Actor, a velocity-reparameterized flow policy with separate yellow and blue actors.
- Critic, a centralized twin-Q over local observations and belief tokens.
- Planning model, a typed object graph dynamics ensemble with rule-risk heads.
- Planner, Flow-proposal lower-tail CVaR MPC followed by the action shield.
- Policy mode, residual expert, so the actor adjusts a rule-aware tactical
  prior and low-level navigation comes from that prior.
- Observation dimension 46 local features per robot.
- Belief-state dimension 368, from `23` tokens by `16` features.
- Action dimension 6 high-level tactical controls.

## Published Legacy Baseline

Generated runtime files live under `isaaclab_sim/output/`. The selected final
metrics are mirrored into `docs/rl_data/world_model_sacflow_final/` for README
figures and regression tests.

## Action Contract

The actor output is clipped to `[-1, 1]` and mapped to the following controls.

- `target_selector` chooses among visible and reachable opponent targets.
- `base_rush_gate` decides when to stop normal-target cleanup and attack base.
- `block_interference_gate` decides whether contact or blocking is worth the risk.
- `recovery_gate` requests relocalization when confidence is low.
- `fire_gate` keeps the laser enabled for the dwell window.
- `risk_preference` trades off closer shots, pushing and route risk.

## Rule And Safety Model

- Robots attack opponent-owned targets only.
- Normal targets are placed about 45 degrees to wall and corner geometry.
- Base targets are smaller, recessed and protected by ground-touching armor.
- Armor blocks both navigation and laser raycast until removed.
- Laser shots require line of sight, legal range and at least `0.80 s` dwell.
- Normal-target shooter-outlet range spans `0.05 m` to `0.50 m`.
- Recessed-base shooter-outlet range spans `0.20 m` to `0.80 m`.
- Pushable red boxes are dynamic rigid obstacles with persistent map poses.
- Static-wall, armor, target and jammed-box penetration grade as strict hard violations.
- Final replay uses full-match traces, and debug snippets stay development artifacts.

## Training

```bash
python3 isaaclab_sim/rl/train_world_model_sacflow_selfplay.py \
  --config isaaclab_sim/rl/configs/world_model_flow.yaml \
  --timesteps 200000 \
  --num-envs 32 \
  --batch-size 1024 \
  --gradient-steps 2 \
  --device cuda \
  --seed 260707 \
  --output ../output/rl/world_model_sacflow_seed260707_rerun
```

## Scoring

```bash
python3 isaaclab_sim/rl/evaluate_strategy_contract.py \
  --checkpoint isaaclab_sim/output/rl/world_model_sacflow_seed260707_rerun/policy.pt \
  --episodes 256 \
  --seed 262100 \
  --stochastic \
  --policy-mode residual_expert \
  --residual-scale 0.04 \

  --output-csv isaaclab_sim/output/eval/world_model_sacflow_microaim_contract_eval256.csv
```

## Strict Replay

```bash
python3 isaaclab_sim/rl/replay_policy_strict.py \
  --checkpoint isaaclab_sim/output/rl/world_model_sacflow_seed260707_rerun/policy.pt \
  --episodes 8 \
  --seed 261000 \
  --stochastic \
  --policy-mode residual_expert \
  --residual-scale 0.04 \
  --output-dir isaaclab_sim/output/replay/world_model_sacflow_strict_replay_abs \
  --report isaaclab_sim/output/replay/world_model_sacflow_strict_replay_abs/strict_replay_audit.md
```

## Export

```bash
python3 isaaclab_sim/rl/export_world_model_sacflow_policy.py \
  --checkpoint isaaclab_sim/output/rl/world_model_sacflow_seed260707_rerun/policy.pt \
  --format torchscript \
  --output-dir isaaclab_sim/output/export/world_model_sacflow_seed260707_rerun
```

## Figures

```bash
python3 isaaclab_sim/rl/generate_rl_figures.py
```

The script reads the mirrored final data from
`docs/rl_data/world_model_sacflow_final/` when present, and otherwise it falls
back to local generated output.
