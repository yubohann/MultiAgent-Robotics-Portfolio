# Strict SAC Flow Replay Audit

Verdict: **PASS**

This report replays the trained object-centric SAC Flow tactical actor and audits each step against strict rule and physics invariants.

## Replay Setup

- checkpoint: `~\RoboCupVisionRL_AutoCommit\isaaclab_sim\output\rl\world_model_sacflow_seed260707_rerun\policy.pt`
- deterministic: `False`
- device: `cuda`
- episodes: `8`
- max step translation: `0.12 m`
- max step yaw delta: `0.27 rad`
- static blocker tolerance: `0.012 m`

## Strict Checks

- action shape is exactly 6D and bounded to [-1, 1]
- robot pose is finite, inside the arena boundary, and outside static blockers
- per-step translation/yaw changes stay within differential-drive limits
- selected targets and fired targets must belong to the opponent
- own-base hit/collision is an immediate hard violation
- scores and armor only change in rule-compatible directions
- target contact is recorded as a warning unless it actually knocks down a target

## Notes

Blocked steps are not counted as hard violations because the costmap/barrier logic prevented penetration. Actual penetration after integration is a hard violation.
A pose that only touches the inflated costmap boundary within the static-blocker tolerance is counted as a warning, not as physical wall penetration.
Pushable-box contact is allowed only within the tolerance; robot-box penetration is a hard violation.
Target contact is allowed only as a non-scoring brush/contact event; any contact-induced knockdown remains a hard violation.
Robot-robot contact is allowed as a tactical event, but it is counted so future training can penalize unsafe or wasteful contact.
